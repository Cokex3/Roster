# Roster: A simple rostering app

Sick of all those paid rosters... Just do it for free. Who cares. I want to help the world not scam it.

Roster is for easily staffing your team. Giving them an online place to check their hours. Print friendly. Planned calendar app support.

> Note: This master branch is abandoned, but functional. I'm slowly moving it to MDC in the [Move-to-MDC](https://github.com/LukeFlego/Roster/tree/Move-to-MDC) branch where it is in development and functionality is scattered
